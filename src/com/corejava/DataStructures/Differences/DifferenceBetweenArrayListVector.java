	 * What are differences between ArrayList and Vector in java?
 	 * 
 	 * Property                    java.util.ArrayList                 java.util.Vector
 	 * 1.synchronization      java.util.ArrayList is not              java.util.Vector is synchronized    
 	 *                        synchronized  (because 2 threads        (because 2 threads on same
 	 *                        on same ArrayList object can access     Vector object can not access it at same time). 
 	 *                        it at same time). 
 	 *                        
 	 * 2.Performance          ArrayList is not synchronized, hence     Vector is synchronized, hence its

 	 *                        to Vector in java.                       to ArrayList in java.
