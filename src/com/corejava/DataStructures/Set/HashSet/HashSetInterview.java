	 *    
	 * 
	 * Features of java.util.HashSet :
	 * 
	 * HashSet  is implementation of the java.util.Set interface in java.
	 * 
	 * HashSet is internally implemented using java.util.HashMap in java.
	 * 
	 * Duplicate elements - HashSet does not allows to store duplicate elements 
	 * in java.
	 * 
	 * Null elements - One null element can be added in HashSet in java.
	 * 
	 * Insertion order - HashSet  does not maintains insertion order in java.
	 * 
	 * synchronized - HashSet is not synchronized (because 2 threads on same 
	 * HashSet object can access it at same time) in java. 
	 * 
	 * Performance - HashSet is not synchronized, hence its operations are 
	 * faster as compared to some other synchronized implementation of Set 
	 * interface in java. 
	 * 
	 * When to use java.util.HashSet :
	 * 
	 * HashSet can be used when we don’t want to store duplicate elements 
	 * in java.
	 * 
	 * HashSet can be used when we want to store only one null in java.
	 * 
	 * We must prefer HashSet for when add and remove operations are more as 
	 * compared to get operations in java, and
	 * 
	 * HashSet can be used when we are not working in multithreading 
	 * environment in java.
	 * 
	 * What is Load Factor in java ?
	 * Default load factor is 0.75
	 * That means when set will be 75% filled,  it’s capacity will be doubled.
	 * Example in java >
	 * Initially when number of elements is 0,  default capacity =16, Load Factor =0.75, HashSet is 0% full.
