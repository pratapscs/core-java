	 *  -java.util.AbstractMap
	 *   -java.util.concurrent.HashMap 
	 *   
	 * Features of java.util.HashMap:
	 * 
	 * HashMap enables us to store data in key-value pair form in java.
	 * 
	 * HashMap is implementation of the java.util.map interface in java.
	 * 
	 * Duplicate key- HashMap does not allows to store duplicate keys. 
	 * If the map already contains a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced 
	 * in java.
	 * 
	 * Null elements - One null key can be added in HashMap. And null values 
	 * are also allowed in HashMap in java.
	 * 
	 * Insertion order - HashMap does not maintains insertion order in java.
	 * 
	 * synchronized - HashMap is not synchronized (because 2 threads on same 
	 * HashMap object can access it at same time) in java. 
	 * 
	 * Performance - HashMap is not synchronized, hence its operations are 
	 * faster as compared to some other synchronized implementation of map 
	 * interface in java. 
	 * 
	 * When to use java.util.HashMap in java:
	 * 
	 * HashMap can be used when we want to store data in key-value pair form in java.
	 * 
	 * HashMap can be used when we want to store only one null key in java.
	 * 
	 * HashMap can be used when value corresponding to key might be null in java.
	 * 
	 * HashMap can be used when we don’t care about insertion order in java.
	 * 
	 * HashMap can be used when we are not working in multithreading environment in java.
