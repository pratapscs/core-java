/*
 * Dictionary is an abstract class that represents a key/value storage 
 * repository and operates much like Map.
 * 
 * Given a key and value, you can store the value in a Dictionary object. 
 * Once the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key. Thus, 
 * like a map, a dictionary can be thought of as a list of key/value pairs.
