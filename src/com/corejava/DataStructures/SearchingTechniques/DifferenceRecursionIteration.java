	 *       RECURSION                                ITERATIONS
	 * Recursive function – is a function          Iterative Instructions –are loop based 
	 * that is partially defined by itself	       repetitions of a process
	 * 
	 * Recursion Uses selection structure          Iteration uses repetition structure
	 * 
	 * Infinite recursion occurs if the            An infinite loop occurs with iteration 
	 * recursion step does not reduce the          if the loop-condition test never becomes false.
	 * problem in a manner that converges
	 * on some condition.(base case)
	 * 
	 * Recursion terminates when a base            Iteration terminates  when 
	 * case is recognized                          the loop-condition fails
	 * 
	 * Recursion is usually slower then            Iteration does not use stack 
	 * iteration due to overhead of                so it's faster than recursion
	 * maintaining stack
	 * 
	 * Recursion uses more memory than iteration   Iteration consume less memory
	 * 
	 * Infinite recursion can crash the system     infinite looping uses CPU
	 * 											   cycles repeatedly
	 * 
	 * Recursion makes code smaller                Iteration makes code longer
