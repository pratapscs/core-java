	/* What is Call by value (Pass by value)? And how java is call by value?
	 * 
	 * Call by value means Copy of an argument is passed to method. 
	 * Therefore, any changes made to the argument in passed method 
	 * won’t change the value of original argument. 
	 * 
	 * In java when any changes are made to the argument in passed method 
	 * the value of original argument is not changed. 
	 * Hence, Java is call by value.
