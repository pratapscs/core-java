	/* Method overloading :
	 * When a class have same method name with different argument, 
	 * than it is called method overloading. 
	 * 
	 * Advantage of method overloading -
	 * Method overloading enables consistency in the naming of methods which 
	 * logically perform almost similar tasks and the only difference is in 
	 * number of arguments. 
	 * 
	 * Method overloading enables same method name to be reused in program.
	 * 
	 * Method overloading is done to make program logically more readable and 
	 * understandable.
	 * 
	 * Method overloading can be done by -
	 * 1.changing number of arguments, or  (Myclass1.java)
	 * 
	 * 2.keeping same number of arguments but changing data data type of arguments. 
	 *  (Myclass2.java)

	 *    accessmodifier   returntype  methodname      noofparameters      Exceptionthrown
	 *         |               |         |                   |                    |
	 *     public            String     food              (int x)     throws  Exception
	 * 
	 * Access modifier - Does not matter.
	 * Return type - Does not matter.
	 * Method name - same method name.
	 * Number of parameters in java - different number of parameters
	 * Exception thrown - Does not matter.
	 * 
	 * Features of Method overloading -
	 * 
	 * 1.Call to overloaded method is bonded at compile time.
	 * 
	 * 2.Method overloading concept is also known as compile time polymorphism in java.
	 * 
	 * 3.Java does not allow overloading by changing the return type, 
	 * though overloaded methods can change the return type. 
	 * 
	 * 4.Method overloading is generally done in same class but can also be done in 
	 * SubClass (MyClass3.java)
	 * 
	 * 5.private methods can be overloaded in java.
	 * 
	 * 6.final methods can be overloaded in java.
	 * 
	 * 7.Main method can also be overloaded in java (MyClass4.java)
	 * 
	 * 8.Both Static and instance method can be overloaded in java.  
	 * (In MyClass1.java below, we have overloaded instance method, likewise we could 
	 * also overload static method)
	 *
