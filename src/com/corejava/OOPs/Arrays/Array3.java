/*3.what is an disadvantage of an array data structure?
 * 
 * Size Limit: We can store only fixed size of elements in the array. 
 * It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in java.
 * 
 * we must in advance that how many elements are to be stored in array.
 * 
 * Array is static structure.It means that array is of fixed size.The memory which 
 * is allocated to array can not be increased or reduced.
 * 
 * Since array is of fixed size,if we allocate more memory than requirement then the
 * memory space will be wasted. And if we allocate less memory than requirement,
 * then it will create problem.
 * 
 * The elements of array are stored in consecutive memory locations.
 * So insertions and deletions are very difficult and time consuming.
